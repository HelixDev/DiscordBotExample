# DiscordBotExample
this repository will help you a bit when you are new to Discord.JS!

# Requirements
you must have these installed to continue.
nodejs (https://nodejs.org/en/)
Any text editor {i prefer VSCode} (https://code.visualstudio.com/)

# Step 1
make sure to paste the files in a new map on your computer.

# Step 2
edit the CONFIG.JSON file, and replace the token with the token of your bot (https://discord.com/developers/applications)

# Step 3
edit the Prefix in your CONFIG as well

# Step 4
open the Node.js command bar, and cd into your bots' map, then, type nmp install discord.js

# Step 5 
almost done! the last thing to do is, in the same command bar, after it installed discord.js, you may execute your bot by typing "node index.js'

Your bot should be online with 1 simple command! :D you can add any commands you like! i am posting more commands on GitHub soon
